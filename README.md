# Pinboard for Dart

A library that provides a nice interface to communicate with the Pinboard API. The library is essentially a typed wrapper to Pinboard's API, meaning that it sometimes does things that don't quite make sense. Blame Pinboard.

## Usage

You can view a complete example of the available API in [the example](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pinboard#-example-tab-). You can also view [the documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/pinboard/latest/), although it's a little verbose.
